# Global Indicators Dashboard for East Africa

## Project Overview
The **Global Indicators Dashboard for East Africa** is an interactive data visualization tool designed to provide actionable insights into key global indicators for East African countries. By integrating data from reliable sources and utilizing advanced analytics, the dashboard enables comparative analysis, trend exploration, and correlation studies across economic, social, environmental, and technological domains.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Provides dynamic charts, maps, and tables for exploring data by country, region, and demographic attributes.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Allows users to compare performance across countries and regions, focusing on East African nations.
- **Time-Series Exploration**: Tracks changes in indicators over time to identify trends and patterns.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Employs filters, slicers, and dynamic descriptions to make data accessible to non-technical audiences.
- **Case Study**: Includes a dedicated analysis of Uganda and its East African neighbors for in-depth insights.

## Data Sources
The dashboard uses data from the following reputable sources:
- **Gapminder**: A rich repository of global development indicators.
- **World Bank Open Data**
- **United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)**
- **United Nations Statistics Division (UNStats)**
- **OECD Data Library**

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: R and Python for data analysis and preprocessing.
- **Libraries**: Highcharter, Leaflet, ggplot2 for advanced visualizations.
- **Frameworks**: Shiny for building the dashboard interface.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on ShinyApps.io with GitHub integration for version control.

## Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition and Cleaning**:
   - Collected datasets from Gapminder and complementary sources.
   - Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted descriptive statistics and visualizations to uncover patterns.
   - Performed correlation and regression analyses.
3. **Dashboard Development**:
   - Designed a modular layout with interactive features for enhanced user experience.
   - Integrated advanced visualization techniques like choropleth maps, time-series charts, and heatmaps.

## Key Insights
- Significant disparities in economic, social, and health indicators among East African countries.
- Positive correlation between education and life expectancy.
- Declining trends in agricultural contributions to GDP across East Africa, highlighting economic diversification.

## Future Work
- **Predictive Analytics**: Integrate machine learning models to forecast indicator trends.
- **Expanded Coverage**: Include all African countries for broader comparisons.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Deploy the dashboard on a more robust server for improved responsiveness.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Incorporate bivariate and multivariate analysis for deeper insights.
